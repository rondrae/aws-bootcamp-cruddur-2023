# Week 2 â€” Distributed Tracing

I was feeling a bit off this week. I understand the importance of tracing and but implementing it, isn't as excited as the other stuff we have done.

I implemented, xray, cloudwatch logs and rollbar so far. I will need to take some time to familiarise myself with these tools but they are all working locally. I found time minutes before week 3 class to add honeycomb. I do everything locally.
