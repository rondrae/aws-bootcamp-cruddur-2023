# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

# FrontEnd and BackEnd working together

I am doing everything locally. So I had to install docker desktop. When I was trying to build out the container and I reach the instructions that npm i, it said it can't find npm. I had no idea what that was. I googled it found it what it was so I installed it. Then when I got to docker compose, the webpage would load but it wouldn't read data from the backend. I now hate CORS as you said in class. I decided to use a browser plugin to temporarily disable it. So I have both front and backend container working together. Now to the other parts.
