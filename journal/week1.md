# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

# FrontEnd and BackEnd working together

I am doing everything locally. So I had to install docker desktop. When I was trying to build out the container and I reach the instructions that npm i, it said it can't find npm. I had no idea what that was. I googled it found it what it was so I installed it. Then when I got to docker compose, the webpage would load but it wouldn't read data from the backend. I now hate CORS as you said in class. I decided to use a browser plugin to temporarily disable it. So I have both front and backend container working together. Now to the other parts.

# Push an image to docker hub

# Notifications

Adding the frontend notification page by copying and editing the code from the main page and also added the notification backend. I used my name as the poster and set my like count to 99 because I am cool like that. Each time I made a change I and relaunch the container, I assume this because I am running it locally and not using Gitpod.
