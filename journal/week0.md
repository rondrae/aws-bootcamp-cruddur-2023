# Week 0 â€” Billing and Architecture
I started by watching live stream. I went on to watch the recommend videos in the checklist.  The first one was the security considerations. I followed what was taught and this is where I enabled MFA for my root account. I then went on to create the diagrams using lucid charts. I first created the conceptual diagram based on how I know systems are design. I have a VMware background. Taking the conceptual diagram I went on to create the logical diagram using lucid charts. I did a similar diagram like the one Andrew taught, not sure if it needs an IGW. I then went on to watch another youtube video from the checklist. This one was about doing stuff in AWS. I went ahead and did some of the other tasks before finishing the video so I did not know to do them from the CLI so I did  everything in the GUI. This includes creating the admin user, billing alarm and creating a budget. I also did not use gitpod, I use vs code and I installed AWS CLI locally to my machine.
